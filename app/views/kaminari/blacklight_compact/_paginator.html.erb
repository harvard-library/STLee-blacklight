<%# The container tag
  - available local variables
    current_page:  a page object for the currently displayed page
    num_pages:     total number of pages
    per_page:      number of items to fetch per page
    remote:        data-remote
    paginator:     the paginator that renders the pagination tags inside

   Paginator now using the Bootstrap paginator class

   page_entries_info is passed into the paginate call, e.g. :

   > paginate collection, :page_entries_info => page_entries_info(collection), :theme => :blacklight_compact

   As of Kaminari 0.15, this paginator doesn't have access to the original collection/scope, so it can't render the page entries info directly.
